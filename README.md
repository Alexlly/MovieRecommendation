## Must run both backend and frontend!



### Backend ！【important】

To set up the backend, you must use an environment running python 3.7. We recommend using anaconda to create an environment to handle this. 

Then follow the steps as below.

```bash
##### From your python 3.7 environment #####

cd backend  # Enter backend folder
unzip 'model&data.zip'  # Only if you haven't unzipped before
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install packages to your python 3.7 environment
python manage.py runserver 
```



### Frontend 【important】

To set up frontend, node and npm must be installed on your machine

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
serve -s dist
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 and enjoy!

Alternatively for the frontend, you can visit http://group30rovierecommendation.s3-website-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com. _**The backend must still be run locally however.**_
