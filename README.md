# Movie Recommendation
42913 ass3 - Enjoy!





### Set up a new App

```bash
 cd backend/apps
 django-admin startapp Movies
```



### Backend ！【important】

To set up the backend, you must use an environment running python 3.7. We recommend creating an anaconda environment to handle this. 

Then follow the steps as below.

```bash
##### From your python 3.7 environment #####
cd backend # Enter backend folder
unzip 'model&data.zip' # Only if you haven't unzipped before
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install packages
python manage.py runserver # Run server
```

### Frontend 【important】

```bash
cd frontend
npm install # If you haven't installed the packages yet
npm run build # for backend
```



### Run

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py runserver
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 and enjoy!
