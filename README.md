## Must run both backend and frontend!

### Backend ！【important】

To set up the backend, you must use an environment running python 3.7. We recommend creating an anaconda environment to handle this. 

Then follow the steps as below.

```bash
##### From your python 3.7 environment #####

cd backend # Enter backend folder
unzip 'model&data.zip' # Only if you haven't unzipped before
pip install -r requirements.txt # Install packages to your python 3.7 environment
python manage.py runserver 
```

### Frontend 【important】

To set up frontend, node and npm must be installed on your machine

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
serve -s dist
```

Then visit http://localhost:3000 and enjoy!
