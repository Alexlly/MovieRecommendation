      <h1> Movie Recommendation System </h1>
      <h3>A project by Group 30 </h3>
      <p> The movie recommendation system aims to give users the ability to find movies most similar to a particualr movie they want. 
        This makes it easy for users to see what other movies they may potentially like, without needing to rely on streaming services recommending
        similar movies only available on their service. This simple webapp aims to give more choice to users when it comes to picking a movie they like.
